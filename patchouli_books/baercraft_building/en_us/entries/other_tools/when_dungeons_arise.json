They are really, really useful for adding diversity in builds around whatever you’re doing.$(br2)I typically remove the spawners so I don’t end up with countless amounts of hostile mobs around me."

Since this section impacts so little people, the update is more than worth it. So, disregard everything I've mentioned above and do this instead (I'm only keeping the portion above for those who haven't/don't want to update"

It can be annoying since you'll most likely have some cleaning up to do, but I suggest once you have done that to save your structure as a schematic, so that you can paste them whenever you want. The hard part is finding the structure you want."
