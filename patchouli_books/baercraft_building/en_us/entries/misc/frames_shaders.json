It’s an option under the video settings (video settings/other/fullscreen if you’re using OptiFine, which you should be!!!) Maybe this is all just common knowledge, but it really helped me out when I didn't have the best GPU :)"

Even though I have a 5k monitor, I typically use 2880x1620 when I’m just playing normally/in the process of building and I use 5120x2880 when taking pictures!$(br2)I know most people don’t like playing in fullscreen, but it’s quite helpful for capturing your builds with shaders!
