# BaerCraft
This repository is an abridged list of files for the Minecraft modpack BaerCraft. 
We are not allowed to put mod files on github so instead we have modlist.html in the mods folder and right above the README.md file. 

You *are* also able to find the files and mod list on the wiki. Please be aware that all of the information on this github is subject to change, and people might not always remember to update it. Don't hurt us :)

The modpack is also accessable on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/baercraft) and you are able to find it on [Discord](https://discord.gg/CKbbFyzrd9)!

> Be sure to check the Wiki!!
