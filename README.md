# BaerCraft
This repository is an abridged list of files for the Minecraft modpack BaerCraft. 
We are not allowed to put mod files on github so instead we have modlist.html in the mods folder and right above this file. 

The modpack is also accessable on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/baercraft) and you are able to find it on [Discord](https://discord.gg/CKbbFyzrd9)!
