# BaerCraft
This repository is an abridged list of files for the Minecraft modpack BaerCraft. 
We are not allowed to put mod files on github so instead we have modlist.html in the mods folder and right above the README.md file. 

You *are* also able to find the files and mod list on the wiki. Please be aware that all of the information on this GitHub is subject to change. Now that the GitHub is synced with Antibang's personal Minecraft game instead of the BaerCraft profile on CurseForge, some of the files (mainly the config files) might be slightly different than what is released for the public. This is the easiest way for Anti to remember to update the files here :)

The modpack is also accessable on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/baercraft) and you are able to find it on [Discord](https://discord.gg/CKbbFyzrd9)!

> Be sure to check the Wiki!!
