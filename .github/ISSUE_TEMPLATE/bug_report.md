# **RULES (READ FIRST)!**

If you have a general question or need something, join the Discord. Make sure I haven't already reported it. Consider these few things **BEFORE** reporting your bug:

**1\.** Is your modpack up to date?

**2\.** Do you have the proper amount of RAM allocated? (Which should be a minimum of 5GB, preferably 8GB. Too much is over 12GB)

---

# **If you've made sure all of those things are correct then proceed to report the bug:**

## **Describe the Bug —**

Give as much detail about the bug as you can while being legible.

## **To Reproduce —**

Steps to reproduce

## **Screenshots —**

Only add screenshots if they’re needed

## **How much RAM have you allocated? —**

You can tell me exactly how much in MB or GB.

## **Have you modified ANY files or added any additional mods? —**

If yes, then please describe exactly what you have modified. If no, then move on.

## **Is Magnesium or Rubidium installed on the profile? —**

If yes, please specify which one. If you did not install either of these, move on.

## **Additional Information —**

Is there anything else I need to know about the bug?

## **Crash Reports / Logs —**

Always provide logs and/or crash reports. For the love of god, DO NOT copy and paste the crash reports or logs. Instead use paste sites like https://pastebin.com/ or https://hastebin.com/. You can also just drag the files into your browser.
