**RULES (READ FIRST)!**

If you have a general question or need something, join the Discord. Make sure I haven't already reported it. Consider these few things **BEFORE** reporting your bug:

**1\.** Is your modpack up to date?

**2\.** Do you have enough RAM allocated? (Which should be a minimum of 5GB, preferably 6GB)

**3\.** Do you have TOO MUCH allocated? (Currently, too much would be more than 10GB, which can cause just as many problems as too little!!!)

**4\.** Do you have OptiFine HD G8 installed? (This can help me further investigate if OptiFine might help with your issue, or if it's causing it)

**5\.** Have you added additional mods, other than OptiFine, or changed configs/scripts? (I cannot help you if you don't specify what you've changed!)

**If you've made sure all of those things are correct then proceed to report the bug:**

**Describe the Bug**
Give as much detail about the bug as you can while being legible.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce

**Screenshots**
Only add screenshots if they're needed

**Additional Information**
Is there anything else I need to know about the bug?

**Crash Reports / Logs**
Always provide logs and/or crash reports. For the love of god, **DO NOT** copy and paste the crash reports or logs. Instead use paste sites like Pastebin or Hastebin.
